## Background

While browsing on YouTube I came across a video about a 1980 Mattel Electronics&trade; Dungeons and Dragons&trade; Computer Labyrinth Game. I found it interesting and it was looking simple enough that I wanted to make a version for the Commander X16, a new 8 bits computer released in 2024 and based on the 6502. I found a javascript version that I forked and here we are.

## Technical Info

This repo consists of a fork of the original version and all the changes that I had to do to recreate it in C for the commander X16

## Game Play

The original game required the user to place and move the game pieces but to make this simulation easier to play, I have the game pieces being placed and moved automatically. Time permitting I may add a "classic" mode later that would rely on the user to manually place and move all the game pieces to make it more like the original game. A [PDF User Manual](./assets/gameManual.pdf) describing the game is also included.
